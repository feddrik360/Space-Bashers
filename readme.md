## SPACE BLASTERS
>
### UX 
> The purpose of this game was to create something that was fun and
>for all ages. The game  starts of very simple and gets more harder
>as the player goes through the levels. The game is very easy to play
>as all they will need to press are the arrow keys and the spacebar.

### Features
> This game allows the user to move around the mains spaceship and shoot at enemy gunships. 
>The user has the option to view the instructions before they start the game or 
>they can decide to start the game straight away. Each level will have a score tracker and a
>timer which allows the user to know exactly how much time they have left to hit the 
>target score which will be stated on the top of the screen. Furthermore, if the user passes
>the level, then the user will have the option to go on to the next level or to return to the main screen. 

> In the future, I would like to make the game responsive so that the game can be played on
> smaller devices. I would also like to add more levels to the game.  
###Testing

- Have tested on different browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari.
- I have tested the each potential collision on each level. For example, the collision between a laser and a Gunship.
- I have made sure that the score does increase where it is needed to be.
- I have made sure that each link on every level works.
- I have asked other people to play the game and give feedback.
- I have checked to see the correct action takes place when the player loses or wins on each level.

### Deployment
> I started of by creating a new repository on Github. Once, I had done this, I opened up my terminal. and typed in the following:

> git init

> git add "File name"

> git commit -m "first commit"

> git remote add origin https://github.com/feddrik360/SecondMS.git

> git push -u origin master
