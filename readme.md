## SPACE BLASTERS
>
### UX 
> The purpose of this game was to create something that was fun
>for all ages. The game begins as a simple manic-shooter game and progresses to become harder, with more enemies and higher target scores.
>The game controls are basic, allowing people to get familiar with the game play quickly.
>Players need to press the arrow keys to move around the game area and the spacebar to shoot lasers at enemies.

### Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- GIT
- GITHUB
- Chrome Developer Tools
- WebStorm (IDE)

### Features
> Space Blasters allows the player to move around the screen as a spaceship that needs to aim and shoot at enemy gunships flying towards it. 
>The player has the option to view the instructions to find out how to play before they start the game or 
>they can decide to play straight away. Each level has a score tracker and a
>timer which allows the user to know exactly how much time they have left to reach the 
>target score (which is stated on the top of the screen). If the player passes
>the level, then they have the option to progress on to the next level or to return to the main screen. If the player
>chooses to return to the main screen, the game will restart at level 1 the next time they play the game.

> In the future, I would like to make the game responsive so that it can be played on
> smaller devices, e.g. mobile phones and tablets. I would also like to add more levels to the game (up to level 10)
>that increase with intensity so that
>the players can test their abilities and feel a sense of satisfaction once they have completed the game.  


### Testing
- I have completed extensive testing of my game on a variety of different browsers such as Google Chrome,
Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari.
- On each browser, the game performed very
well, however on FireFox, there was a lot of lag after the game was played a couple of times.
- I tried to resolve this issue with the 
FireFox debugging tools, but unfortunately I was not able to find out what was causing this.
- I have tested every potential collision on all 3 levels, e.g. the collision between a laser and a gunship. This was all working fine.
- I have made sure that the score increases by the correct amount every time the player hits an enemy gunship or UFO. 
- I have made sure that each link on every level works.
- I have asked other people to play the game and give feedback. The main point raised was that the game
was very challenging, but this made the players want tro keep playing in order to try to defeat the game. They also said
that the controls were easy to use and the aim of the game was simple and easy to follow.
- I have checked to see the correct action takes place when the player loses or wins on each level, i.e. 'GAME OVER' or 'YOU HAVE PASSED'.

### Deployment
> I started by creating a new repository on Github. Once, I had done this, I opened up my terminal and typed in the following;

- git init

- git add "File name"

- git commit -m "first commit"

- git remote add origin "Your link for the website"

- git push -u origin master

> Once I had typed in the above, I clicked on "Settings". In the settings page I changed the source to the 
> master branch. After this had been done, a link for my site was published.

### Credits
> I took the foundations of my game from the following YouTube series, available at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no.
> Inspiration was also provided to me from Jared York's tutorial, available at: https://yorkcs.com/2019/02/06/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/.
