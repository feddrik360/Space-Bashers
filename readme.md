## SPACE BLASTERS
>
### UX 
> The purpose of this game was to create something that was fun and
>for all ages. The game  starts of very simple and gets more harder
>as the player goes through the levels. The game is very easy to play
>as all they will need to press are the arrow keys and the spacebar.

### Features
> This game allows the user to move around the mains spaceship and shoot at enemy gunships. 
>The user has the option to view the instructions before they start the game or 
>they can decide to start the game straight away. Each level will have a score tracker and a
>timer which allows the user to know exactly how much time they have left to hit the 
>target score which will be stated on the top of the screen. Furthermore, if the user passes
>the level, then the user will have the option to go on to the next level or to return to the
>main screen. 

> In the future, I would like to make the game responsive so that the game can be played on
> smaller devices. I would also like to add more levels to the game.
